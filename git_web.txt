Instructions for Hosting Money Matrix Web Application

===============================================

Option 1: GitHub Pages (Static Content Only)
--------------------------------------------
GitHub Pages can only host static websites, not dynamic Flask applications. However, you can use it to showcase documentation or a static landing page.

1. Create a gh-pages branch:
   git checkout -b gh-pages

2. Add static content to this branch (HTML, CSS, JS files only)

3. Push the branch to GitHub:
   git push origin gh-pages

4. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click Settings > Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose gh-pages
   - Save settings

Note: This won't host the actual Flask application, only static content.

Option 2: Heroku (Recommended for Flask Applications)
-----------------------------------------------------
Heroku is ideal for hosting Flask applications like Money Matrix.

1. Install Heroku CLI:
   Download from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

2. Login to Heroku:
   heroku login

3. Create a new Heroku app:
   heroku create your-app-name

4. Add a Procfile to your project root with:
   web: gunicorn app:main

5. Update requirements.txt to include gunicorn:
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

6. Commit the changes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Heroku deployment files"

7. Deploy to Heroku:
   git push heroku main

8. Set environment variables in Heroku:
   heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   heroku config:set FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=your_firebase_credentials_path

Option 3: PythonAnywhere
------------------------
PythonAnywhere can host Flask applications easily.

1. Create an account at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/

2. Upload your code using Git or direct upload

3. Create a new web app and configure it to point to your app.py file

4. Set up environment variables in the dashboard

5. Reload the application

Option 4: Google Cloud Run
--------------------------
Cloud Run can containerize and deploy your Flask app.

1. Install Google Cloud SDK

2. Create a Dockerfile in your project root:
   FROM python:3.10-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 5000
   CMD ["gunicorn", "app:main"]

3. Build and deploy:
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/money-matrix
   gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/money-matrix --platform managed

Option 5: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
-------------------------------
Elastic Beanstalk supports Python applications.

1. Install EB CLI

2. Initialize your application:
   eb init

3. Create environment and deploy:
   eb create

4. Deploy updates:
   eb deploy

Important Notes:
---------------
1. Make sure to set all required environment variables in your hosting platform:
   - SECRET_KEY
   - FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS
   - DATABASE_URI

2. For Firebase integration to work, you'll need to upload your firebase_credentials.json file to your hosting platform and update the FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS path accordingly.

3. Some hosting platforms may require modifications to the application for it to work properly. Check the specific platform's documentation for Python/Flask deployments.

Recommended Starting Point:
--------------------------
For beginners, Heroku is the easiest option to get started with hosting your Flask application. It has a free tier that should work for development and small-scale deployments.
